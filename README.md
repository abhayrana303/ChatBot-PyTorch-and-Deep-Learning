Introduction 
 This Chatbot is Based on the JSON file. Any json data you provide it give they the response according to file. Just provide it JSON data file and train it.
 This chatbot act accordingly.
 
Modules 
1.Theory+ NLP concept: 
• This module focuses on educating users about fundamental NLP concept such as stemming, tokenization, bag-of-words. 
• It will provide clear explanation, example, and use cases to help users understand hoe these concepts are applied in Natural Language Processing tasks

2. Training data: 
• In this module, we explained how the data is created for chatbot. This involves gathering a dataset in which questions and responses that a chatbot will learn from. 
• Here, we cover the structure, training data and label the data appropriately and ensure sufficient diversity to cover different scenarios and user input  

3. PyTorch Model and Training: 
• This module delves into the implementation of the chatbot using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. 
• Here, we designed the architecture of chatbot, which may involve techniques like recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) or transformer depending on the requirements. 
• Training procedures, including data preprocessing, model compilation, loss optimization and hyperparameter tuning, will be covered in this module.
 
5. Load and implement the chat: 
• The final module focuses on loading the trained chatbot model and implementing it in chat interface. 
• Techniques for saving and loading model checkpoints for future use 
• Deployment considerations: hosting options, scalability, security etc. 
• Monitoring, maintenance, updating chatbot, troubleshooting and debugging.
  
User Interface Details 
User interface of the chatbot look more professional while retaining simplicity and flexibility. Consider the followings -> 

1. User Input Field: 
• We used a clean and modern text input field with decent styling, such as slightly round corner and light border, etc. 
• Provide place holder text inside the input field i.e. “Type your question here or search here.”

3. Send Button: 
• We designed a sleek and clearly visible send button that contrasts well with the background color of the input field 
• Appropriate sign of the send button is used.

4. Chatbot Responses Window: 
• Response area is designed as a well spacious area above the input area to display the chatbot responses. 
• We have applied consistent typography and formatting for the chatbot responses, such as using a readable font and maintaining consistent spacing

6. Overall Design; 
• We choose a neutral color scheme with subtle accents to create a professional and inviting appearance. 
• We ensure that the layout is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen size, maintaining usability across various devices.
